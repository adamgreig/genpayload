Does coffee's implicit return in jquery event handlers cause problems?
 -- yes: either add 'return' (i.e., null) to all or scan for potential problems

fx
parser tester flask app

add tips to some places? maybe?
 - #sentence_edit white space to the right would be a good place to put tips on field naming and units and stuff
 - si units

maybe html5 url/history

custom jquery ui build (?)
minify all the things
bundle into single file (?)

browser sorting.
    currently:
        [name, -created] for pcfg, pcfg.sentence[i]
        name for flight
    (since expect pcfgs with same name, but not for flights?)
    could do all by created desc..., or just flight, or...
    search so is ok.

load times. make it fast, or fake it
