sentence_edit: collect data, filters

stop modifying stuff when the ui events fire and instead collect afterwards:
e.g., pcfg sortable sentences list: why not just use $(blah).data to attach sentence dicts to each li
then collect at end.

flight_edit
database access
fx
general prettyfying
parser tester flask app
add tips and stuff everywhere
 - what is a 'flight' (a flight train/balloon/launch), 'payload' (stuff in a box), (grouping info)
 - #sentence_edit white space to the right would be a good place to put tips on field naming and units and stuff

maybe use em instead of px in the css? I hear it's all the rage
maybe nice font
maybe html5 url/history
