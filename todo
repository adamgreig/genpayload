general prettyfying
parser tester flask app
add tips and stuff everywhere
 - what is a 'flight' (a flight train/balloon/launch), 'payload' (stuff in a box), (grouping info)
 - #sentence_edit white space to the right would be a good place to put tips on field naming and units and stuff
 - si units

maybe use em instead of px in the css? I hear it's all the rage
maybe nice font
maybe html5 url/history

todo
 - custom jquery ui build
 - minify all
 - bundle into single file
