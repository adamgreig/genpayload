really bad things are happening with rfc3339 dates.
When parsed, the timezoneJS object.hours is UTC hours, but it's meant to be local hours.


fx
general prettyfying
parser tester flask app
add tips and stuff everywhere
 - what is a 'flight' (a flight train/balloon/launch), 'payload' (stuff in a box), (grouping info)
 - #sentence_edit white space to the right would be a good place to put tips on field naming and units and stuff
 - si units
 - move stuff from front page into editing sections?

maybe use em instead of px in the css? I hear it's all the rage
maybe nice font
maybe html5 url/history

custom jquery ui build (?)
minify all the things
bundle into single file (?)

browser sorting.
    currently:
        [name, -created] for pcfg, pcfg.sentence[i]
        name for flight
    (since expect pcfgs with same name, but not for flights?)
    could do all by created desc..., or just flight, or...
    search so is ok.

review quick start links - maybe confusing. Also really want to click Continue; maybe quickstart next page
 if keep: maybe modify so cancel buttons work?

load times. make it fast, or fake it
